# DEEP LEARNING

## Overview

Pytorch implementations of deep learning fundamentals.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- __Lab1__: linear and logistic regression
  implementations.

- __Lab2__: forward and reverse mode automatic
  differentiation. 

- __Lab3__: optimization methods implementation like SGD, SGD
  with momentum and ADAM.

- __Lab4__: a multilayer perceptron classifier implementation
  trained on the MNIST dataset.

- __Lab5__: a convolutional neural network classifier
  implementation trained on the MNIST dataset.

- __Lab6__: transfer learning applied on a ResNet architecture to
  achieve boat classification.

- __Lab7__: text analysis tools and text generation implementations.

- __Lab8__: autoencoder implementation applied to Zalando's
  Fashion-MNIST dataset.
